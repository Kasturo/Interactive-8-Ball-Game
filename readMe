A school project that utilizes C libraries which I programmed that implement functions to simulate ball collision of billiard balls with cushions and other balls. It then utilizes Python webservers to interact with the C library to create svg format images. Databases are then used the Python code to store the pool tables. The final bit of the assignment involved creating a website that allowed for an interactive 8-ball game.
